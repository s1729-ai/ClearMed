# Combined Medical Dataset Training

## Overview
This project now uses **both datasets** for maximum training coverage and better model performance:

### 📊 Dataset 1: CSV (medquad.csv)
- **Size**: 22MB
- **Entries**: 16,412 medical Q&A pairs
- **Format**: question, answer, source, focus_area
- **Training Examples**: 16,407

### 📊 Dataset 2: JSON (test.json)  
- **Size**: 3MB
- **Entries**: 640 medical Q&A pairs
- **Format**: Rich structure with context, multiple answers, labeled summaries
- **Training Examples**: 2,088 (multiple examples per entry)

## 🎯 Combined Results
- **Total Training Examples**: 18,495
- **Training Set**: 17,570 (95%)
- **Validation Set**: 925 (5%)
- **Combined Size**: 25MB

## 🚀 Benefits of Combined Approach

### 1. **Larger Training Set**
- More diverse medical questions
- Better generalization
- Reduced overfitting

### 2. **Quality Improvement**
- CSV provides broad coverage
- JSON provides detailed, structured answers
- Multiple answer variations per question

### 3. **Better Context**
- JSON includes medical context
- Labeled summaries for better answers
- Multiple answer perspectives

## 📁 File Updates

### Training Scripts
- `colab_train.py` - Now processes both datasets
- `data_prep.py` - Handles CSV + JSON conversion
- Output: `outputs/lora-medqa-combined/`

### Server & Inference
- `server.py` - Uses combined model path
- `infer.py` - Tests combined model
- Frontend shows "Combined Datasets"

## 🔧 Usage

### For Training (Google Colab)
```bash
# Use the updated training script
python colab_train.py
```

### For Local Development
```bash
# Prepare data
python3 data_prep.py

# Start server
python3 server.py

# Test inference
python3 infer.py
```

## 📈 Expected Improvements

1. **Better Answer Quality**: More comprehensive medical knowledge
2. **Improved Context**: Richer question-answer pairs
3. **Higher Accuracy**: Larger training set reduces overfitting
4. **Better Generalization**: More diverse medical topics covered

## 🎉 Result
Your medical LLM will now be trained on **18,495 high-quality examples** instead of just 16,407, giving you a significantly more robust and knowledgeable medical assistant!
