## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Model Loading Failed
```bash
# Check if model files exist
ls -la model.safetensors config.json

# Test model loading
python test_model.py
```

#### 2. Dependencies Missing
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install torch transformers fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

#### 3. Server Won't Start
```bash
# Check if port 8000 is available
lsof -i :8000

# Use different port
python server.py --port 8001
```

#### 4. Frontend Can't Connect
- Ensure server is running on `http://localhost:8000`
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify API endpoint in `app.js`
