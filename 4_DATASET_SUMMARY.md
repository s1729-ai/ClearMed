- **Coverage**: Detailed medical explanations with context

### **Dataset 3: train.json**
- **Size**: 11MB
- **Entries**: 2,236 medical Q&A pairs  
- **Training Examples**: 6,965 (multiple examples per entry)
- **Format**: Same rich structure as test.json
- **Coverage**: Extensive medical knowledge base

### **Dataset 4: valid.json**
- **Size**: 4.6MB
- **Entries**: 959 medical Q&A pairs
- **Training Examples**: 3,102 (multiple examples per entry)
- **Format**: Same rich structure as other JSON datasets
- **Coverage**: Additional medical scenarios and edge cases

## 🎯 **Combined Results**

- **Total Training Examples**: **28,562** (vs. 18,495 before)
- **Training Set**: 27,133 (95%)
- **Validation Set**: 1,429 (5%)
- **Combined Size**: 40.6MB
- **Improvement**: **+54% more training data**

## 🚀 **Benefits of 4-Dataset Approach**

### 1. **Massive Training Set**
- 28,562 high-quality examples instead of 18,495
- Better generalization and reduced overfitting
- More diverse medical topics covered

### 2. **Quality Improvement**
- CSV provides broad coverage and reliable sources
- JSON datasets provide detailed, structured answers
- Multiple answer variations per question
- Rich context and labeled summaries

### 3. **Comprehensive Medical Knowledge**
- Broader range of medical conditions
- More treatment options and explanations
- Better understanding of medical terminology
- Enhanced ability to handle complex queries

## 📁 **Updated File Structure**

### **Training Scripts**
- `colab_train.py` - Now processes all 4 datasets
- `data_prep.py` - Handles CSV + 3 JSON datasets
- Output: `outputs/lora-medqa-4datasets/`

### **Server & Inference**
- `server.py` - Uses 4-dataset model path
- `infer.py` - Tests 4-dataset model
- Frontend shows "4 Combined Datasets"

## 🔧 **Usage Instructions**

### **For Training (Google Colab)**
```bash
# Upload and run the updated training script
python colab_train.py
```

### **For Local Development**
```bash
# Prepare data from all 4 datasets
python3 data_prep.py

# Start server
python3 server.py

# Test inference
python3 infer.py
```

## 📈 **Expected Improvements**

1. **Better Answer Quality**: 54% more training data
2. **Improved Context**: Richer question-answer pairs
3. **Higher Accuracy**: Larger training set reduces overfitting
4. **Better Generalization**: More diverse medical topics
5. **Enhanced Medical Knowledge**: Comprehensive coverage

## 🎉 **Final Result**
